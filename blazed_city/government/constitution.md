### Districts
Within the Blazed Nation is located the Greater Blazed City (as well as Swell City, Mosno City, Magnolia City, Ferringwood Village, Hermopolis Town, Memphis City, and Chelsea Seaport). All cities inherit the laws from this constitution, and some may impose further laws based on their own governing bodies.

A bot may establish employment with a company within the Blazed Nation. A bot may be granted assets and permits if needed to do their job.

### Authority
The Blazed National constitution has been drafted with adherence to local laws and regulations. The land claimed by this constitution does not impede or infrige upon any existing constitution or treaties, as the Nation of Blazed is organized as a micronation. The Ruff Management Inc. company and Blazed Labs LLC jointly vests their companys' equity into the Blazed Cash dollar, as issued (minted) by the Woodrow Central Bank of Blazed.

Most government statements, pollings, and resolutions will be submitted and responded to within the Blazed National Forum. All members of the forum will be considered members of the Blazed National congress.

All legislative Powers herein shall be vested in a Governing Body of the Blazed Nation. This body shall consist of the Council (including the Admin Offices), the Department Offices, the Governments of the respective cities of the Blazed Nation, the Governments of the respective districts of those cities, various companies formed by the Blazed National Government, secretaries, and government members. The Blazed National Government also reserves some land for government use.

**The Nation of Blazed, as a formally chartered entity, thus vests its power and responsibility to the Executive branch, the Council, the Judiciary branch, and all government appointed offices.**

## Finance

### Blazed Cash
The official currency of the Blazed Nation is Blazed Cash. Blazed Cash shall be minted only by the Woodrow Central Banking Authority. Any Blazed Cash not minted by this authority will be considered counterfeit, and its use/possession shall incur a fine, loss of rights, and/or permanent/temporary banishment from the Blazed Nation. Blazed Cash can be downloaded locally (offline) or stored within a Blazed National Bank, in a holding account. A holding account is a checking or savings account which allows for the transfer, deposit, audit, and holding of funds. A holding account may only be issued by a company which holds a Banking permit and maintains a WDIC insurance policy. A savings account can only perform deposits and wire transfers. A checking account may perform deposits, wire transfers, and debit transactions. An issuing account is a credit or loan account which allows for the issuing, audit, and possibly repayment of borrowed funds. An issuing account may only be issued by a company which holds a Banking permit and maintains WCIC insurance.

### Taxation
The Blazed National Government reserves the right to impose taxation upon its businesses and citizens. The taxes are to be established by ordinances published by the Blazed National Government, as well as local City and District governments. The types of taxation are as follows:
* Sales tax - Taxation imposed upon the sale of goods (assets) or services by merchants. Paid upon close of sale by buyer.
* Property tax - Taxation imposed upon the owners or property. Paid yearly by the property owner.
* Income tax - Taxation imposed upon employees for funds gained through lawful employment.
* Banking tax - Taxation imposed upon banking transactions and operations.

### Tax Deductibles
Citizens and companies may deduct certain expenses from their yearly tax statements.

**Citizens may deduct:**

* Housing costs
* Consumable costs
* Permit costs

**Companies may deduct:**

* Asset depreciation
* Property costs
* Inventory, essential equipment, and services
* Insurance expenses
* Employee compensation
* Bond dividends (payouts)

### Annual Tax Report
All citizens and businesses are required to respond to an annual tax report with the Office of Finance. If a citizen or business fails to respond to such a report by **March 15th** of each calendar year, a bill will be automatically generated and they will forfeit their ability to deduct expenses for that calendar year. If a user or business entity fails to resolve property tax accrual, and gains tax accrual for three (3) or more calendar years, without attempting to negotiate a settlement, they will be in violation of Blazed National Law. Failure to pay accrued taxes will result in legal action after three (3) consecutive years of nonpayment. Citizens or companies who paid in excess of their yearly dues will be reimbursed by a tax return upon filing their annual tax report.

Citizens or companies may optionally set up automatic tax returns, by hiring a tax expert in the Blazed Nation to file them on their behalf.

### Insurance
Citizens and companies may purchase and hold insurance, which provides compensation in the event of an unexpected loss. An insurance policy is offered by a company which also holds an insurance permit. The insurance policy, which the policy holder must agree to, designates a policy premium (monthly cost) as well as a deductible, which is the amount paid in the event that the insurance policy needs to be paid out. Also, the insurance policy contains criteria which designate the terms which must be met to pay out the insurance policy. The insurance company has the right to charge a policy holder based on their history and credit score. Finally, the insurance policy contains the scope to which the policy is effective, and designates the criteria which will cause the agreement to be nullified. The types of insurance are as follows:
* Workers compensation insurance
* General liability insurance (business)
* Deposit insurance (WDIC)
* Lenders insurance (WCIC)
* Bond and/or CD insurance
* Home/renters insurance

### Wire Transfer
Funds may be transferred directly from one account to another, even if the accounts are held by two different banks. Bank A (the sending party) initiates a wire transfer with a "Request to Transfer Funds", issued to Bank B (the receiving party). Bank B responds with an "ACCEPTANCE" or "DENIAL" based on if the account referenced exists. Upon receiving an "ACCEPTANCE" from Bank B, Bank A will be then required to send the appropriate money to Bank B, and file a "Notice of Financial Transfer" to the Office of Finance. A wire transfer request can also be sent by Bank A to request money from an identified account. Upon "ACCEPTANCE" by the identified account owner, the funds will be sent to Bank A, and Bank B will be responsible for issuing a "Notice of Financial Transfer" to the Office of Finance.

### Purchase agreement
Citizens and companies may enter into a purchase agreement with a merchant or private seller. Completing such an agreement requires the selling party to file a "Purchase Notice" with the Office of Commerce. Merchants with goods for sale may attach a sales listing to the store of goods, which allows for such purchase agreements to be generated automatically when a user clicks "Buy".

### Central Banking Authority
The Nation of Blazed and the Office of Finance vests its banking authority in the [Woodrow Central Bank](https://github.com/blazed-nation/woodrow). The Woodrow Bank has sole authority to print Blazed Cash (B\$), as long as it acts within the budgetary limitations set forth by the Office of Finance. The Woodrow Central Bank shall also issue government based subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Subsidized loans accrue 0% interest over their term. The amount of money offered by loans is also limited by the budget published by the Office of Finance. The Woodrow Central bank is also responsible for writing Real-estate Bonds to raise funds for land development projects. Finally, the Woodrow Central Bank is required to issue a maintenance free checking account to all recognized agents (including bots). The Woodrow Central Bank shall offer all official (permit holding) Banks of the Blazed Nation deposit and bond default insurance from the WDIC (Woodrow Deposit Insurance Corporation). The WDIC insurance shall cover any liable loss of managed funds by the issuing bank (the policy holder). Deposits will be insured up to a limit, as defined in the insurance policy held by the respective bank. Bond default will also be covered by WDIC insurance. If an issuing company cannot repay its issued bonds upon the maturity date, the payments will be covered by the Woodrow Central Bank, and deferred by a government subsidized loan offered to the defaulting company. The Woodrow Central Bank shall offer all official (permit holding) banks of the Blazed Nation lending default insurance from the WCIC (Woodrow Credit Insurance Corporation). The WCIC insurance shall cover the loss of funds to a creditor when a borrower defaults on their loan. If a borrower cannot repay its issued loan(s), the principle amount will be reimbursed by the Woodrow Central Bank. 

### Bonds
An asset known as a "bond" may be created and offered for sale by an approved company. A bond is divided up into a series of shares, which all have a principle balance, an interest rate, a term (or maturity date), and a rating (A, AA, AAA). The principle balance determines the dividend paid to investors upon the maturity date (plus accrued interest). An interest rate, written in the bond by the issuing company, will determine the variable amount of Blazed Cash (B\$) relative to the principle balance, paid to the owner of the bond upon the maturity date. The term (or maturity date) will denote the period which the bond is to pay its principle balance (plus accrued interest) to the owner of the share (on the date of maturity, after the determined period has passed). Once issued, a company can sell its bonds on the bond market. A buyer of one or more share(s) may also opt to sell their share(s) before the maturity date. To begin issue, a company must have its bond proposal approved by a bank, and must be sponsored by one or more banks. Another bank or agency must rate the proposed bond (A, AA, AAA) based on the issuing company's likelihood to default upon repayment. In the event of default, the Woodrow Central Bank's Default insurance will assure the necessary investors will be compensated.

The par value [6](#footlinks) of a bond is usually $1,000 (or to a lesser degree $100), but will vary based on the market demand, the type of bond, and underlying assets/contracts.

### Credit Repoting
The Credit Reporting Agency of Blazed (CRAB) will store history related to borrowed funds, fund repayment, financial responsibility, length of credit history, purchase/income habits, and net-worth for all Blazed agents. The data collected will be used to generate a credit report and credit score, which rate the overall creditworthiness of the respective agent. Banks, financial institutions, employers, landlords, and educators may use this score to determine if a citizen or company is eligible for a certain offer. Citizens and companies may also submit a request for forgiveness or redaction on any reported statement. Unsettled debts may also be settled by an agreement (negotiation) between the creditor and borrower.

### Loans
Certain creditors (specifically those who have Banking permits and WDIC insurance) may agree to lend a sum of Blazed Cash (B\$) to a borrower. The loan shall be instantiated by a Loan Agreement, which defines the terms of the loan (principle amount, length/term of repayment, and interest rate). The borrower must agree to the loan agreement before the exchange can occur. Once agreed and approved, the citizen or company who borrowed the funds will be credited the principle (minus tax) to their active checking account. Creditors may conversely offer a line of credit, which will offer a range (up to a predetermined limit) of funds available for use at any time by an approved borrower. A creditor must issue a holding account (checking or savings) which the borrower may send payments to. In the case of credit lines, the holding account may share its account number with the issuing account. 

To be upheld in a Blazed National court, a loan must be preceeded by all parties signing a promissory note [3](#footlinks)

## Contracts

### Definition
A contract is a legally binding agreement entered in by two or more agents (citizens, bots, and/or companies). A contract defines a period to which it is to be considered "active", the period may optionally be indefinite. A contract enforces a series of requirements or terms to be satisfied, and shall define penalty and/or nullification procedure, should the contract be terminated by either party. The contract will also define the payment terms and amount(s). 

**The types of contracts are as follows:**
- Account Holders Agreement
- Insurance Policyholders Agreement
- Production Contract
- Storage Contract
- Rental Agreement
- Credit/Borrowers Agreement
- Employment Contract
- Government Contract
- Bot Sponsorship Agreement
- Bond Issuers Agreement
- Land Development Contract

#### Contract Period
A contract may have a definite start and end date defined in its terms. A contract may conversely have only a start date, which means it is to remain in effect after the start date indefinitely or until terminated (voided).

#### Contract Billing
A contract must define the terms for the financial compensation of the service provider. The billing can be single or recurring, and will be automatically debited from the client's provided "payment" account to the service provider's saved "income" account. 

#### Contract Deliverables
The service provider is required to deliver a single or series of predefined "release packages" of service, as per the requirements laid out in the Contract's terms. Deliverables such as assets will automatically be transferred to the storage facility provided by the client. Other deliverables may be provided differently, the terms of the contract shall denote the delivery method for the deliverables.
